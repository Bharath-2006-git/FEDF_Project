# Carbon Sense Design Guidelines

## Design Approach: Fresh Interactive Experience
Moving beyond traditional dashboard patterns, Carbon Sense will feature an innovative card-based interface with immersive visualizations and gamified sustainability tracking.

## Core Design Principles
- **Interactive Immersion**: Card-stack interfaces with swipe gestures and floating panels
- **Environmental Storytelling**: Visual feedback that reflects user's carbon impact
- **Gamified Engagement**: Achievement trees and progress animations
- **Gesture-First Navigation**: Floating action buttons and intuitive controls

## Color Palette
**Dynamic Performance-Based Theming**: Colors adapt based on user's carbon footprint performance

- **High Performance (Low Carbon)**: 
  - Primary: 142 69% 58% (forest green)
  - Secondary: 195 100% 85% (sky blue)
  - Background: 210 20% 98% (light)

- **Medium Performance**:
  - Primary: 45 93% 47% (amber)
  - Secondary: 200 18% 46% (slate)
  - Background: 60 9% 98% (warm light)

- **Needs Improvement**:
  - Primary: 14 90% 53% (coral red)
  - Secondary: 220 14% 96% (cool gray)
  - Background: 0 0% 98% (neutral light)

**Dark Mode**: Rich environmental blacks (220 13% 9%) with neon accent highlights

## Typography
- **Primary**: Inter (Google Fonts) - Clean, modern readability
- **Display**: Poppins (Google Fonts) - Friendly, approachable headers
- **Monospace**: JetBrains Mono - Data and metrics display

## Layout System
- **Spacing**: Tailwind units 2, 4, 8, 12, 16 for consistent rhythm
- **Card System**: Floating panels with subtle shadows and rounded corners
- **Grid**: Masonry-style layout for emission cards and achievements

## Component Library

### Navigation
- **Floating Action Buttons**: Primary navigation anchored to screen edges
- **Card Stack Navigation**: Swipeable card interfaces for data entry
- **Breadcrumb Particles**: Animated trail showing user journey

### Data Visualization
- **Emission Particles**: 3D particle systems representing carbon output
- **Morphing Charts**: Animated transitions between chart types
- **Achievement Trees**: Branch-like progress visualization
- **Timeline Scrubber**: Drag-and-drop emission logging interface

### Interactive Elements
- **Swipe Cards**: Gesture-based emission entry
- **Floating Panels**: Modal-like overlays for detailed views
- **Progress Rings**: Circular progress with environmental animations
- **Impact Meters**: Real-time visual feedback during data entry

### Forms
- **Inline Editing**: Click-to-edit fields within cards
- **Smart Suggestions**: Auto-complete with environmental context
- **Visual Input**: Slider controls with immediate visual feedback

## Animations
- **Card Transitions**: Smooth swipe and stack animations
- **Particle Effects**: Subtle environmental particles for feedback
- **Achievement Unlocks**: Celebratory animations for milestones
- **Data Morphing**: Smooth transitions between visualization states

## Images
**Environmental Context Imagery**:
- **Hero Background**: Large atmospheric image of renewable energy landscape (wind turbines, solar panels in natural setting)
- **Card Backgrounds**: Subtle nature textures (leaves, water, sky) as overlay backgrounds
- **Achievement Badges**: Custom illustrated environmental icons (trees, clean energy symbols)
- **Empty States**: Friendly illustrations encouraging sustainable actions

**Image Placement**:
- Hero section: Full-width environmental landscape
- Dashboard cards: Subtle background textures
- Achievement section: Icon-based illustrations
- Loading states: Animated environmental scenes

## Unique Features
- **Environmental Mood**: UI elements respond to user's carbon performance
- **Gesture Navigation**: Swipe-based interactions throughout
- **Live Feedback**: Real-time visual responses to user actions
- **Achievement Theater**: Immersive celebration of sustainability milestones

This fresh approach transforms carbon tracking from a mundane dashboard into an engaging, visually rich experience that motivates sustainable behavior through innovative interaction patterns.
