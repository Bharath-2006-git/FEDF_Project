## Technology Stack

### Frontend
- **Framework**: React 18.3.1 with TypeScript 5.6.3
- **Build Tool**: Vite 5.4.19 for fast development and optimized builds
- **UI Components**: Radix UI primitives with custom styling
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS 3.4.15 with custom design system
- **Animations**: Framer Motion 11.13.1 for smooth interactions
- **Icons**: Lucide React for consistent iconography
- **Routing**: Wouter 3.3.5 for lightweight client-side navigation
- **State Management**: TanStack Query (React Query) 5.60.5 for server state
- **Form Handling**: React Hook Form 7.55.0 with Zod validation

### Backend
- **Runtime**: Node.js with Express.js 4.21.2
- **Language**: TypeScript with tsx for development execution
- **Authentication**: Passport.js with JWT tokens and bcryptjs hashing
- **Session Management**: express-session with connect-pg-simple
- **API**: RESTful endpoints with type-safe request/response handling

### Database & ORM
- **Database**: Supabase (Postgres) for hosted backend and authentication
- **ORM**: Drizzle ORM 0.39.1 for type-safe database operations
- **Schema Management**: Drizzle Kit for migrations and schema generation
- **Validation**: Zod 3.24.2 for runtime type validation across the stack

### Data Visualization
- **Charts**: Recharts 2.15.2 for responsive, React-native charts
- **Data Processing**: Custom emission calculation algorithms
- **Export**: PapaParse 5.4.1 for CSV data export functionality

### Development Tools
- **Type Safety**: Shared TypeScript types across frontend/backend
- **Code Quality**: ESLint 9.13.0 with TypeScript rules
- **Build Process**: esbuild for production server bundling
- **Development**: Concurrently for running multiple development servers
- **Environment**: cross-env for cross-platform environment variables

### Key Architectural Decisions
- **Monorepo Structure**: Shared types between client/server via `/shared` directory
- **Type-First Development**: Database schema generates TypeScript types automatically
- **Runtime Validation**: Zod schemas ensure data integrity at API boundaries
- **Modern Tooling**: Vite + esbuild for optimal development and build performance

## Quick Start

### System Requirements
