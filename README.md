## Technology Stack

### Frontend
- **Framework**: React 18.3.1 with TypeScript 5.6.3
- **Build Tool**: Vite 5.4.19 for fast development and optimized builds
- **UI Components**: Radix UI primitives with custom styling
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS 3.4.15 with custom design system
- **Animations**: Framer Motion 11.13.1 for smooth interactions
- **Icons**: Lucide React for consistent iconography
- **Routing**: Wouter 3.3.5 for lightweight client-side navigation
- **State Management**: TanStack Query (React Query) 5.60.5 for server state
- **Form Handling**: React Hook Form 7.55.0 with Zod validation

### Backend
- **Runtime**: Node.js with Express.js 4.21.2
- **Language**: TypeScript with tsx for development execution
- **Authentication**: Passport.js with JWT tokens and bcryptjs hashing
- **Session Management**: express-session with connect-pg-simple
- **API**: RESTful endpoints with type-safe request/response handling

### Database & ORM
- **Database**: Supabase (Postgres) for hosted backend and authentication
- **ORM**: Drizzle ORM 0.39.1 for type-safe database operations
- **Schema Management**: Drizzle Kit for migrations and schema generation
- **Validation**: Zod 3.24.2 for runtime type validation across the stack

### Data Visualization
- **Charts**: Recharts 2.15.2 for responsive, React-native charts
- **Data Processing**: Custom emission calculation algorithms
- **Export**: PapaParse 5.4.1 for CSV data export functionality

### Development Tools
- **Type Safety**: Shared TypeScript types across frontend/backend
- **Code Quality**: ESLint 9.13.0 with TypeScript rules
- **Build Process**: esbuild for production server bundling
- **Development**: Concurrently for running multiple development servers
- **Environment**: cross-env for cross-platform environment variables

### Key Architectural Decisions
- **Monorepo Structure**: Shared types between client/server via `/shared` directory
- **Type-First Development**: Database schema generates TypeScript types automatically
- **Runtime Validation**: Zod schemas ensure data integrity at API boundaries
- **Modern Tooling**: Vite + esbuild for optimal development and build performance

## Quick Start

### System Requirements

- Node.js 18.0 or higher
- npm or yarn package manager
- Supabase project (Postgres) or compatible Postgres database

### Installation & Setup

1. **Clone and navigate to the project**:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd CarbonSense
```

2. **Install dependencies**:
```bash
npm install
```

3. **Configure environment**:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```
Edit the `.env` file with your database credentials and configuration settings.

4. **Initialize database**:
```bash
npm run db:push
```

5. **Launch development environment**:

   **Client only** (frontend development):
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   
   **Full stack** (both frontend and backend):
   ```bash
   npm run dev:full
   ```

The application will automatically find available ports and start:
- Frontend (Vite): Usually on `http://localhost:5173` (or next available port)
- Backend API: Usually on `http://localhost:3000` (or next available port)

**Note**: The application now intelligently finds available ports, so you don't need to worry about port conflicts!

## Available Scripts

- `npm run dev` - Start Vite development server (frontend only)
- `npm run dev:full` - Start both frontend and backend servers concurrently
- `npm run dev:server` - Start backend server only
- `npm run dev:client` - Start frontend client only
- `npm run build` - Create optimized production build
- `npm run start` - Run production server
- `npm run check` - Run TypeScript type checking
- `npm run db:push` - Push database schema changes

## Port Configuration

The application uses dynamic port allocation:

- **Vite Dev Server**: Automatically finds available port starting from 5173
- **Backend API**: Automatically finds available port starting from 3000 (configurable via `PORT` env variable)
- **No port killing**: The project no longer kills existing processes on ports
- **Cross-platform**: Works seamlessly on Windows, macOS, and Linux

If you need to specify custom ports, you can:
- Set `PORT=3001` in your `.env` file for the backend
- Vite will automatically increment ports if 5173 is busy
