- Complex features require specialized expertise

### **3. Demonstration Value**
- Core features already demonstrate full-stack skills
- Additional features add complexity without proportional value
- Current scope is impressive for college project

### **4. Time Constraints**
- 6-week timeline for current scope
- Additional features would add 3-4 weeks each
